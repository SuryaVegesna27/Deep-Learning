Deep Learning Model Deployment: Utilized DenseNet201 for automatic detection of brain tumors in MRI scans, achieving a classification precision and recall between 97-98% and 95-99% respectively.

Segmentation Performance: Implemented ResUNet for precise tumor localization, resulting in an F1-score ranging from 0.96 to 0.98, indicating a strong balance between precision and recall.

Data Handling and Preprocessing: Managed a dataset where approximately 34.95% of images showed tumors. Preprocessing involved rescaling, segmentation mask application, and division into training and testing sets using ImageDataGenerator.

Consistent Model Accuracy: Demonstrated consistent model performance with weighted averages for precision, recall, and F1-score all at 0.97, essential for the reliability needed in medical diagnostics.
