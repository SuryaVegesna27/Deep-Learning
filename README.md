## Automated Tumor Detection using DenseNet201
# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using- Deep-Learning

### Description
This project aims to develop an automated deep learning-based system for early detection and localization of brain tumors in MRI scans. Leveraging the DenseNet201 architecture for image classification and ResUNet for precise segmentation, the system enhances diagnostic accuracy, reduces analysis time, and provides consistent, reliable results.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Python 3.7** or higher installed
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** libraries installed

### Installation and Setup
To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-tumor-detection.git
   cd automated-tumor-detection
   ```

2. **Set up the Python Environment:**
   Create a virtual environment and install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open and run `automated-tumor-detection-using-densenet201.ipynb` in Jupyter.

### Using the Project
Once the Jupyter Notebook is open, you can run the cells to execute the following steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Assemble a comprehensive dataset of MRI scans.
   - Normalize pixel values and split the dataset into training and validation sets.
   - Use TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator` for data augmentation.

2. **Model Configuration and Training:**
   - Instantiate DenseNet201 as the base model for feature extraction.
   - Freeze pre-trained weights initially, then fine-tune for tumor detection.
   - Add a classification head and compile the model with appropriate loss functions and metrics.
   - Train the model using the augmented dataset.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
   - Use the trained model to classify new MRI scans and segment tumor regions.

### Key Findings
- **High Precision and Recall:** The model achieves 97-98% precision and 95-99% recall, indicating excellent accuracy in identifying brain tumors.
- **Strong F1-Score:** An F1-score between 0.96 and 0.98 demonstrates a strong balance between precision and recall, crucial for medical diagnostics.

### Results Analysis and Interpretation
- **Consistency and Accuracy:** The automated system provides consistent analysis, avoiding human interpretation variability and enabling early and accurate diagnosis.
- **Scalability:** The system can handle large volumes of MRI scans, making it a robust solution for high-demand healthcare environments.
